# Sorting-Visualizer-Using-JavaScript
The goal of the project is to create a web application that can visualize how different sorting algorithms work by animating the process of sorting an array of random data.

We implemented six different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. The user can select which algorithm they want to visualize from a dropdown menu, and the corresponding algorithm is applied to the randomly generated data.

Each algorithm was implemented as an asynchronous function that allows the visualization to be paused at certain points, which enables us to display the steps of the algorithm in the animation. We used the HTML5 Canvas API to draw the bars representing the data and used requestAnimationFrame() to update the canvas and create the animation.

Overall, the project helped us understand how different sorting algorithms work and how we can use JavaScript to visualize them.
